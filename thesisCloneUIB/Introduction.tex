\chapter{Introduction}
Attitude sensors are more and more widely used and their price is decreasing. We can find them in many electronic systems designed for specific purposes. Some examples are in wearable devices, navigation or control systems. We can use some of the devices for covering new use cases and developing new systems. I still didn't find any device that fulfills all my requirements for developing new data processing algorithms.

The goal of this work is to develop a new device with several sensors and a user programmable controller. So, why we don't use a mobile phone? Well, the device should be able to run a real time user program and to read the sensors at precisely specified frequency. The size and weight of the device is also very important. With the decreasing price of MEMS sensors and controllers we are able to build cheaper and lighter device than a smart phone.

This paper goes through the development process of new embedded hardware including manufacturing, testing, API implementation, firmware implementation and the first use of the prototype outside laboratory. Each topic is discussed in separate chapter.

I tried to design the hardware with high versatility, but the main motivation was to create a device for logging data from sensors and analysing them in real time. When the device is mounted on a horse's body, the real time analysis is able to detect the type of movement of this horse.
